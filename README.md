## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I learned and practiced how to buid a simple landing page with just CSS for now.
- Focusing on the use of display grid and flex.

### Continued development

- I´m a beginner, so there are still many parts to perfect. 
- The one I realized now was about display grid, which I´m still a little unsure of using and sizing.
- Another part I struggled with was stylling the social media buttons, I believe there is a better way to do this.
- I also want to get more experience and make a better README in future.

## Acknowledgments

- The only source I used to build this site was the knowledge from the DEV QUEST course.
